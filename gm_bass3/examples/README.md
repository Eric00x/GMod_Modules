# GM_BASS3 Examples and Tests
The ```bass3_test``` example/demo addon contains test cases and usage examples.
This should make your live easier if you want to figure out how to use gm_bass3.

You can also use it to take a quick look at the module.

You install it as a normal GMod addon and run concommands with these prefixes:
- ```sv_b3t_*```,  ```sv_bass3test_*``` for the serverside
- ```cl_b3t_*```,  ```cl_bass3test_*``` for the clientside

The console will tell you what test function was run and where you find it.

For instance you can open the FX Test Panel like the one below by entering ```cl_b3t_fx``` or ```cl_bass3test_``` in the console.
